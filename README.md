  # ORM E-commerce Back-end App - Challenge 13

  ## Description: 
  Our challenge was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. We took a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. I was successful in generating much of the functionality required though I had difficulty with the Update features at times. I will need to come back and try to clarify the information that needs to be passed in to those routes to get them to work.

  ## Usage
  You can launch my app by accessing the project repository on my github. Once opened, run the schema in the db folder in the MySQL shell and seed the created database using the command "npm run seed". Then you may launch the app by entering the command "node server.js" in the command line.

  ## Contributions
  I took guidance on certain functionality from TA Paul Cwik and also collaborated on logic, functionality, and workflow with my classmates Leah Roman, Jordan Harris, Matthew Bronstein, Yasmin Bustami and Jackson Myhre.

  ## Testing
  You may test the app's functionality through Insomnia and can see my walkthrough at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1af32fS3ue5JXDZjuMRQ0W69sQzK9UEHJ/view).
